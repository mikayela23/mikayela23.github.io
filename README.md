St. Joseph, my gentle guardian,
In the silence of your life, I hear the loudest echo of love.
You, who said so little but gave so much,
Are the quiet strength I look to when mine runs low.

When fear creeps in, when doubt clouds my path,
You are the glimmer of hope God sends â€”
Not in thunder or fire,
But in the steady presence of a father who never leaves.

You protected the Holy Family with a carpenter's hands
And a heart full of unwavering trust.
Teach me that same trust,
To believe that God is working even when I cannot see it.

Stand beside me as you stood beside Jesus.
Guide me with your silence, strengthen me with your faith,
And hold me in the prayers you whisper to Heaven.
In your quiet way, remind me://
God is near, and I am not alone.

Amen.

St. Joseph, my gentle guardian, <br>
In the silence of your life, I hear the loudest echo of love.<br>
You, who said so little but gave so much,<br>
Are the quiet strength I look to when mine runs low.<br>
<br>
When fear creeps in, when doubt clouds my path,<br>
You are the glimmer of hope God sends â€”<br>
Not in thunder or fire,<br>
But in the steady presence of a father who never leaves.<br>
<br>
You protected the Holy Family with a carpenter's hands<br>
And a heart full of unwavering trust.<br>
Teach me that same trust,<br>
To believe that God is working even when I cannot see it.<br>
<br>
Stand beside me as you stood beside Jesus.<br>
Guide me with your silence, strengthen me with your faith,<br>
And hold me in the prayers you whisper to Heaven.<br>
In your quiet way, remind me:<br>
God is near, and I am not alone.<br>
<br>
Amen.
